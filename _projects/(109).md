# Jellyfish

###### 2016

Human beings have always sought durability in time, i.e. immortality. Countless scientific researches, numerous philosophical dissertations, deal with the possibility or not of spending more and more time in this dimension. From thinking about what we eat every day to the most advanced medical studies and interventions, the question is the same: what will it be like to be immortal?
The jellyfish is the only creature that can live forever. Not only is it immortal, but it can also clone itself. We could say that it is the least complex species and at the same time the one with the most unknown biological characteristics.

This work represents the life cycle of the jellyfish, where the circulating water allows this infinite movement.
