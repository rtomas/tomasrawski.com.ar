# Drown your sorrows

###### 2019

This work tries to make the spectator activate his unconscious and think about his problems, when reading the phrase "Drown your sorrows" in a cleaning bucket. Then he can decide whether or not to participate in it by moving the stones to the bucket with water, so that somehow "drown" them and free himself from them in a ritual format.

The action of moving is one of the oldest. Whether it's for food, water, housing or just to go to another city. A symbol aimed at changing something's place so that it stops being what it was, is always a gesture of renewal. A symbolic piece that aims to make the viewer participate and release his fears and obstacles in life.
