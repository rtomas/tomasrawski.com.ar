# Oid Mortales

###### 2020-2023

What will happen to those who didn't have fun when we wake up and they tell us it was all a game?

Heal the country Argentina. Find the balance. A set of symbolic repairs that play to achieve it. In the Argentinian national anthem they tell us "Hear, mortals, the sacred cry ..."
And I only dedicate myself to do that.

I like to think that we are all the same stick. At the tip it seems that there is a crack and I would be the semiprecious stone joining and making pieces.

**<ins>"Casa Tierra"</ins>**
I allowed myself to change the name of Casa Rosada to Casa Tierra. Using a darker color range.
As a ritual, I think it would be interesting if land was brought from all the provinces and with that the building is painted year after year.

**<ins>"Look at the river"</ins>**
The work "Mirar el río" arises from the need to make a symbolic reparation of the city in relation to the loss of the link between the people and the river. In this sense, the work seeks, through a ritual action, to give the people of Buenos Aires a view of the Río de la Plata.
