# Oid Mortales

###### 2020-2023

In addition to inflation and the socioeconomic gap, Argentina has also been caught in a cycle of circularity, with the country seemingly unable to break free from repeating the same problems over and over again.

Each time the country experiences an economic crisis, the government implements short-term solutions that fail to address the underlying issues, and the cycle continues. This has led to a sense of frustration and disillusionment among the population, who have grown tired of seeing the same problems reoccurring.

The political divide between the right and left has only contributed to this sense of circularity, with each side unable to agree on a long-term solution. Until there is a concerted effort to break free from this cycle, Argentina will continue to struggle with inflation and socioeconomic inequality, perpetuating the same problems for years to come.

These are a set of symbolic repairs that play to heal the country. In the Argentinian national anthem they tell us "Hear, mortals, the sacred cry ..."

I like to think that we are all the same stick. At the tip it seems that there is a crack and I would be the semiprecious stone joining and making pieces.

**<ins>"Casa Tierra"</ins>**

I allowed myself to change the name of Casa Rosada to Casa Tierra. Using a darker color range.
As a ritual, I think it would be interesting if land was brought from all the provinces and with that the building is painted year after year.

**<ins>"Look at the river"</ins>**

The work "Mirar el río" arises from the need to make a symbolic reparation of the city in relation to the loss of the link between the people and the river. In this sense, the work seeks, through a ritual action, to give the people of Buenos Aires a view of the Río de la Plata.
