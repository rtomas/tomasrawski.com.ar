# Ojo, mi cielo (watch out, my sky)

###### 2017

The work "Ojo, mi cielo" was carried out in 2017 in a former cell in the "Espacio de Arte Contemporáneo" from Montevideo, Uruguay, which was formerly the Migueletes prison. This consists of a meticulous study of the color of the sky through a camera and a computer system designed to obtain the tone of the sky second by second.

This project is designed in relation to the situation that people deprived of their liberty live on a daily basis, for whom heaven is no longer something that goes unnoticed. On the contrary, the sky comes to symbolize everything of which they are deprived. Looking at it for a person who cannot move freely implies an action of resignation but at the same time of resistance, of humanity and of waiting for something better.
