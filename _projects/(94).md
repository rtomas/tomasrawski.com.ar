# Inmutable Peace

###### 2024, Interactive Art
[http://peace.tomasrawski.com.ar](http://peace.tomasrawski.com.ar)

A contemporary manifesto where technology,
art and the collective desire for peace merge.

Each participant chooses a color, their personal
interpretation of peace.

This color, linked to a Smart Contract on the
blockchain, becomes immutable, reflecting the
permanent nature of harmony.

Peace, as a principle, cannot be erased or altered,
just like these colors inscribed in an eternal record.
