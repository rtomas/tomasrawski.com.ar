# Akashic Oracle

###### 2025, Interactive Web Art
[https://akashic-cards.tomasrawski.com.ar/](https://akashic-cards.tomasrawski.com.ar/)

41 illustrated cards (ink on paper, digitized), participant’s spoken or choose question

A quiet browser window becomes a ritual space. Visitors speak—or choose a question. In response, three cards slide onto the screen, chosenfrom Tomás Rawski’s hand-drawn Akashic deck. Each card carries a distilled symbol from the artist’s own cycles of healing and observation; together, the trio forms a temporary constellation around the seeker’s question.

By offering three sequential insights rather than a single sign, Akashic Cards deepens the reflective pause, inviting users to sense patterns, tensions and resolutions among the images. The work extends Rawski’s practice of “symbolic repair,” transforming a private act of guidance into a shared digital ceremony that collapses distance and time, yet leaves interpretation in the hands of each participant. Here, technology does not replace intuition; it stages it, reminding us that meaning is made in the space between question and answer.
