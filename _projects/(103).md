# The leader's ego

###### 2018, Digital Prints 30x20cm

Each leader is tied to his investiture, the colors they wear are not random and in general they are tied to a protocol that is difficult to break.

The clothing gives a status and allows them to be easily identified and exercise their power using it.

The raised index finger calls us to reflect on the ego. The leader tries to communicate a message, but how to be heard to propose changes and improvements to his followers, if previously there was no introspection to know oneself? How to propose a course to others without first marking each one?

The gesture of three fingers pointing at the pointer and a fourth finger pointing outwards, presents us with a case of reflection on the moral authority of various leaders and their power of conviction over their followers.
