# Miramar Miracielo

###### 2015

A city constantly looking at the horizon between the sky and the sea, almost united by a line so straight that separates them.

Miramar Miracielo is a work that investigates the colour of the horizon. Through a series of digitally intervened videos, this work made in the city of Miramar, Province of Buenos Aires, questions the presence of the horizon in the daily sight of the city's residents. How does this line that separates the blue of the sky from the blue of the water determine or prefigure the creation, organisation and development of the place?
