# Flow

###### 2017

The work is an interactive installation, which is activated when a viewer places his finger on a fingerprint reader.

By pressing the finger on the reader, a specially designed system, scans the fingerprint and shows on the screen the fusion between the fingerprint and the video of a sea wave in a cenital way.

The fingerprint is a part of our body that identifies us as unique and different from other human beings. It is important to clarify that it does not change over time.

The water of the wave flows and with its movement cleans and purifies what it finds in its path.

The fingerprint and the water are the specific activators. A piece whose symbolism brings to the present the idea of art as a means of healing.
