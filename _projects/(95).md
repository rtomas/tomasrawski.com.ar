# Open Dream Colors

###### 2023, net blockchain art

A blockchain education art project that combines the realms of creativity and technology.

It serves as an interactive platform where individuals can explore and deepen their understanding of blockchain while expressing their visions through colors. 
Participants are encouraged to learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology, its decentralized nature, and its potential applications. 
They can then contribute their dream color to a shared digital canvas, representing their aspirations and dreams within the blockchain space. 

Each color added is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability, thus fostering a collaborative and decentralized art experience. 
Through this project, people not only gain knowledge about blockchain but also become active participants in a collective artistic endeavor.
